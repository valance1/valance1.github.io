Hi! My name is Gabriel Pinotti, I have passion and admiration towards 2D and 3D art and currently engage in 3D Animation and 2D Character Drawing. I began my love for crafting art when I was 12, playing with stickfigure and mineimator to make my creations. I studied in a really nice Institution where I got a technical course on informatics. Besides that, I occasionally do Video Editing, VFX and Programming.  
Currently I'm 19 years old, I spent the last years studying to get into medical school, which made me take a huge break. However, animation is still my main hobby.
